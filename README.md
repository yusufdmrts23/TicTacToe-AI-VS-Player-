# TicTacToe-AI-VS-Player-
This code creates a game loop that allows a human player to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. 
The AI uses a simple strategy to determine its next move: it first checks if it can win in the next move, 
then checks if the human player can win in the next move and blocks them, and then tries to take a corner or the center of the board if possible
