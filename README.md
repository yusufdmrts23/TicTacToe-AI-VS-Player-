# TicTacToe-AI-VS-Player-

Using a minimax algorithm:
This implementation allows the AI to always choose the optimal move, so it will never lose if it plays perfectly
This code allows one player to play as 'X' and the other player to be controlled by the AI as 'O'. The AI will use the minimax 
function to calculate the optimal move to make, and the human player can enter their own move. 
The game will end when one player wins or when there are no more empty spaces on the board.
